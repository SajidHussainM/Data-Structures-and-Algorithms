Problem Statement
Given an array with N elements, the task is to reverse all the array elements and print the reversed array.
Input Format:
The first line contains an integer N representing the size of the array.

The second line contains N space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.
Output Format:
The only line of the output prints N space-separated integers representing the Reversed array elements.
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^3
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
1 <= K < N
Sample Input:
8
7 5 2 11 2 43 1 10
Sample Output:
10 1 43 2 11 2 5 7
Explanation Of Sample Input:
Here the elements have been reversed.

Solution:

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    //Write your code here
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    int a[n];
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        cin>>a[i];
    }
    for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--){
        cout<<a[i]<<" ";
    }

    return 0;
}
